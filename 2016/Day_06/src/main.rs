/*
 * --- Day 6: Signals and Noise ---
 *
 * Something is jamming your communications with Santa. Fortunately, your signal
 * is only partially jammed, and protocol in situations like this is to switch
 * to a simple repetition code to get the message through.
 *
 * In this model, the same message is sent repeatedly. You've recorded the
 * repeating message signal (your puzzle input), but the data seems quite
 * corrupted - almost too badly to recover. Almost.
 *
 * All you need to do is figure out which character is most frequent for each
 * position.
 *
 * PART 1:  Given the recording in your puzzle input, what is the error-
 *          corrected version of the message being sent?
