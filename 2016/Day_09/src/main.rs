/*
 * --- Day 9: Explosives in Cyberspace ---
 *
 * Wandering around a secure area, you come across a datalink port to a new part
 * of the network. After briefly scanning it for interesting files, you find one
 * file in particular that catches your attention. It's compressed with an
 * experimental format, but fortunately, the documentation for the format is
 * nearby.
 *
 * The format compresses a sequence of characters. Whitespace is ignored. To
 * indicate that some sequence should be repeated, a marker is added to the
 * file, like (10x2). To decompress this marker, take the subsequent 10
 * characters and repeat them 2 times. Then, continue reading the file after the
 * repeated data. The marker itself is not included in the decompressed output.
 *
 * If parentheses or other characters appear within the data referenced by a
 * marker, that's okay - treat it like normal data, not a marker, and then
 * resume looking for markers after the decompressed section.
 *
 * PART 1:  What is the decompressed length of the file (your puzzle input)?
 *          Don't count whitespace.
