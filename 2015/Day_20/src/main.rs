/*
 * --- Day 20: Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses ---
 *
 * To keep the Elves busy, Santa has them deliver some presents by hand, door-
 * to-door. He sends them down a street with infinite houses numbered
 * sequentially: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
 *
 * Each Elf is assigned a number, too, and delivers presents to houses based on
 * that number:
 *
 *  -   The first Elf (number 1) delivers presents to every house: 1, 2, 3, 4,
 *      5, ....
 *
 *  -   The second Elf (number 2) delivers presents to every second house: 2,
 *      4, 6, 8, 10, ....
 *
 *  -   Elf number 3 delivers presents to every third house: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,
 *      ....
 *
 * There are infinitely many Elves, numbered starting with 1. Each Elf delivers
 * presents equal to ten times his or her number at each house.
 *
 * PART 1:  What is the lowest house number of the house to get at least as
 *          many presents as the number in your puzzle input, 34000000?
