/*
 * --- Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum ---
 *
 * Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional
 * grid of houses.
 *
 * He begins by delivering a present to the house at his
 * starting location, and then an elf at the North Pole calls
 * him via radio and tells him where to move next. Moves are
 * always exactly one house to the north (^), south (v), east
 * (>), or west (<). After each move, he delivers another
 * present to the house at his new location.
 *
 * However, the elf back at the north pole has had a little too
 * much eggnog, and so his directions are a little off, and
 * Santa ends up visiting some houses more than once.
 *
 * PART 1: How many houses receive at least one present?
