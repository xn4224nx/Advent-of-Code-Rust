/*
 * --- Day 8: Matchsticks ---
 *
 * Space on the sleigh is limited this year, and so Santa will be bringing his
 * list as a digital copy. He needs to know how much space it will take up when
 * stored.
 *
 * It is common in many programming languages to provide a way to escape special
 * characters in strings. For example, C, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and even PHP
 * handle special characters in very similar ways.
 *
 * However, it is important to realize the difference between the number of
 * characters in the code representation of the string literal and the number of
 * characters in the in-memory string itself.
 *
 * Santa's list is a file that contains many double-quoted string literals, one
 * on each line. The only escape sequences used are \\ (which represents a
 * single backslash), \" (which represents a lone double-quote character), and
 * \x plus two hexadecimal characters (which represents a single character with
 * that ASCII code).
 *
 * PART 1:  Disregarding the whitespace in the file, what is the number of
 *          characters of code for string literals minus the number of
 *          characters in memory for the values of the strings in total for the
 *          entire file?
