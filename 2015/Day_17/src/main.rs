/*
 * --- Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much ---
 *
 * The elves bought too much eggnog again - 150 liters this time. To fit it all
 * into your refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers. You
 * take an inventory of the capacities of the available containers.
 *
 * PART 1:  Filling all containers entirely, how many different combinations of
 *          containers can exactly fit all 150 liters of eggnog?
