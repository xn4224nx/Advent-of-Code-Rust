/*
 * --- Day 14: Parabolic Reflector Dish ---
 *
 * The platform is covered in large rocks of various shapes. Depending 
 * on their position, the weight of the rocks deforms the platform, and 
 * the shape of the platform controls which ropes move and ultimately 
 * the focus of the dish.
 * 
 * In short: if you move the rocks, you can focus the dish. The platform
 * even has a control panel on the side that lets you tilt it in one of 
 * four directions! The rounded rocks (O) will roll when the platform is
 * tilted, while the cube-shaped rocks (#) will stay in place. You note 
 * the positions of all of the empty spaces (.) and rocks (your puzzle 
 * input).
 * 
 * You notice that the support beams along the north side of the 
 * platform are damaged; to ensure the platform doesn't collapse, you 
 * should calculate the total load on the north support beams.
 * 
 * The amount of load caused by a single rounded rock (O) is equal to 
 * the number of rows from the rock to the south edge of the platform, 
 * including the row the rock is on. (Cube-shaped rocks (#) don't 
 * contribute to load.)
 * 
 * Part 1 - Tilt the platform so that the rounded rocks all roll north. 
 *          Afterward, what is the total load on the north support 
 *          beams?
