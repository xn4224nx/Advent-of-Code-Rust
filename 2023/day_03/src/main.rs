/*
 * --- Day 3: Gear Ratios ---
 *
 * The engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the 
 * engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can add up all the part 
 * numbers in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is 
 * missing.
 *
 * The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation 
 * of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really 
 * understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, 
 * is a "part number" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not 
 * count as a symbol.)
 *
 * Part 1: What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?
