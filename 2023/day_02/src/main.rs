/* 
 * --- Day 2: Cube Conundrum ---
 *
 * As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either 
 * red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret 
 * number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out 
 * information about the number of cubes.
 *
 * To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach
 * into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put 
 * them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.
 *
 * The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the 
 * bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?
 *
 * Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded 
 * with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. What is the sum of
 * the IDs of those games?
