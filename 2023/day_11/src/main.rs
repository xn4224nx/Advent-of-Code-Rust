/*
 * --- Day 11: Cosmic Expansion ---
 * 
 * The researcher has collected a bunch of data and compiled the data 
 * into a single giant image (your puzzle input). The image includes 
 * empty space (.) and galaxies (#).
 * 
 * The researcher is trying to figure out the sum of the lengths of the 
 * shortest path between every pair of galaxies. However, there's a 
 * catch: the universe expanded in the time it took the light from those
 * galaxies to reach the observatory.
 * 
 * Due to something involving gravitational effects, only some space 
 * expands. In fact, the result is that any rows or columns that contain
 * no galaxies should all actually be twice as big.
 * 
 * Only count each pair once; order within the pair doesn't matter. For 
 * each pair, find any shortest path between the two galaxies using only
 * steps that move up, down, left, or right exactly one . or # at a 
 * time. (The shortest path between two galaxies is allowed to pass 
 * through another galaxy.)
 * 
 * Part 1 - Expand the universe, then find the length of the shortest 
 *          path between every pair of galaxies. What is the sum of 
 *          these lengths?
