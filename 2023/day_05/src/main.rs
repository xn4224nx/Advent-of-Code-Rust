/*
* --- Day 4: Scratchcards ---
*
* The almanac (your puzzle input) lists all of the seeds that need to be 
* planted. It also lists what type of soil to use with each kind of seed, what 
* type of fertilizer to use with each kind of soil, what type of water to use 
* with each kind of fertilizer, and so on. Every type of seed, soil, fertilizer 
* and so on is identified with a number, but numbers are reused by each category
* - that is, soil 123 and fertilizer 123 aren't necessarily related to each 
* other.
*
* The almanac starts by listing which seeds need to be planted. The rest of the 
* almanac contains a list of maps which describe how to convert numbers from a 
* source category into numbers in a destination category. That is, the section 
* that starts with seed-to-soil map: describes how to convert a seed number (the
* source) to a soil number (the destination).
*
* Rather than list every source number and its corresponding destination number 
* one by one, the maps describe entire ranges of numbers that can be converted. 
* Each line within a map contains three numbers: the destination range start, 
* the source range start, and the range length.
*
* Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination 
* number. So, seed number 10 corresponds to soil number 10.
*
* Part 1 - What is the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the 
*          initial seed numbers?
