/*
* --- Day 8: Haunted Wasteland ---
*
* One of the camel's pouches is labeled "maps" - sure enough, it's full of
* documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least,
* you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list
* of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe
* some kind of network of labeled nodes.
*
* It seems like you're meant to use the left/right instructions to navigate the
* network. Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you can
* escape the haunted wasteland!
*
* After examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out: AAA and ZZZ. You feel
* like AAA is where you are now, and you have to follow the left/right
* instructions until you reach ZZZ.
*
* Starting with AAA, you need to look up the next element based on the next
* left/right instruction in your input. Of course, you might not find ZZZ right
* away. If you run out of left/right instructions, repeat the whole sequence of
* instructions as necessary.
*
* Part 1 - Starting at AAA, follow the left/right instructions. How many steps
*          are required to reach ZZZ?
