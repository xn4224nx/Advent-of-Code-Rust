/*
 * --- Day 12: Hot Springs ---
 *
 * There's just one problem - many of the springs have fallen into
 * disrepair, so they're not actually sure which springs would even be
 * safe to use! Worse yet, their condition records of which springs are
 * damaged (your puzzle input) are also damaged! You'll need to help
 * them repair the damaged records.
 *
 * In the giant field just outside, the springs are arranged into rows.
 * For each row, the condition records show every spring and whether it
 * is operational (.) or damaged (#). This is the part of the condition
 * records that is itself damaged; for some springs, it is simply
 * unknown (?) whether the spring is operational or damaged.
 *
 * However, the engineer that produced the condition records also
 * duplicated some of this information in a different format! After the
 * list of springs for a given row, the size of each contiguous group of
 * damaged springs is listed in the order those groups appear in the
 * row. This list always accounts for every damaged spring, and each
 * number is the entire size of its contiguous group (that is, groups
 * are always separated by at least one operational spring: #### would
 * always be 4, never 2,2).
 *
 * Equipped with this information, it is your job to figure out how many
 * different arrangements of operational and broken springs fit the
 * given criteria in each row.
 *
 * Part 1 - For each row, count all of the different arrangements of
 *          operational and broken springs that meet the given criteria.
 *          What is the sum of those counts?
