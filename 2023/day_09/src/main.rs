/*
 * --- Day 9: Mirage Maintenance ---
 *
 * The OASIS produces a report of many values and how they are changing
 * over time (your puzzle input). Each line in the report contains the
 * history of a single value.
 *
 * To best protect the oasis, your environmental report should include a
 * prediction of the next value in each history. To do this, start by
 * making a new sequence from the difference at each step of your
 * history. If that sequence is not all zeroes, repeat this process,
 * using the sequence you just generated as the input sequence. Once all
 * of the values in your latest sequence are zeroes, you can extrapolate
 * what the next value of the original history should be.
 *
 * Part 1 - Analyze your OASIS report and extrapolate the next value for
 *          each history. What is the sum of these extrapolated values?
