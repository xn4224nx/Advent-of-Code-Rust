/*
* --- Day 6: Wait For It ----
*
* You get a sheet of paper (your puzzle input) that lists the time allowed for
* each race and also the best distance ever recorded in that race. To guarantee
* you win the grand prize, you need to make sure you go farther in each race
* than the current record holder.
*
* Holding down the button charges the boat, and releasing the button allows the
* boat to move. Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time
* spent holding the button counts against the total race time. You can only hold
* the button at the start of the race, and boats don't move until the button is
* released.
*
* Your toy boat has a starting speed of zero millimeters per millisecond. For
* each whole millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the
* button, the boat's speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond.
*
* To see how much margin of error you have, determine the number of ways you can
* beat the record in each race.
*
* Part 1 - Determine the number of ways you could beat the record in each race.
*          What do you get if you multiply these numbers together?
