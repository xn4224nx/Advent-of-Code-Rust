/*
 * --- Day 13: Point of Incidence ---
 * 
 * After a while, you make your way to a nearby cluster of mountains 
 * only to discover that the valley between them is completely full of 
 * large mirrors. Most of the mirrors seem to be aligned in a consistent
 * way; perhaps you should head in that direction?
 * 
 * As you move through the valley of mirrors, you find that several of 
 * them have fallen from the large metal frames keeping them in place. 
 * The mirrors are extremely flat and shiny, and many of the fallen 
 * mirrors have lodged into the ash at strange angles. Because the 
 * terrain is all one color, it's hard to tell where it's safe to walk 
 * or where you're about to run into a mirror.
 * 
 * You note down the patterns of ash (.) and rocks (#) that you see as 
 * you walk (your puzzle input); perhaps by carefully analyzing these 
 * patterns, you can figure out where the mirrors are!
 * 
 * To find the reflection in each pattern, you need to find a perfect 
 * reflection across either a horizontal line between two rows or across
 * a vertical line between two columns.
 * 
 * To summarize your pattern notes, add up the number of columns to the 
 * left of each vertical line of reflection; to that, also add 100 
 * multiplied by the number of rows above each horizontal line of 
 * reflection.
 * 
 * Part 1 - Find the line of reflection in each of the patterns in your 
 *          notes. What number do you get after summarizing all of your 
 *          notes?
