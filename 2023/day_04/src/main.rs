/*
* --- Day 4: Scratchcards ---
*
* It looks like each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar
* (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have.
*
* As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which
* of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match
* makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the
* point value of that card.
*
* Part 1: How many points are they worth in total?
